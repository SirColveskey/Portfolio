# Portfolio
My personal portfolio including code selected from coursework and personal projects.

##Table of Contents

###Computer Organization
* Cache Simulator (C)

		A C project which simulates the transformations to the cache which occur given operations.

* MIPS Assembler (C)

		A base level MIPS assembler, written in C.

* Pipeline Simulator (C)

		Simulates the progress of a pipelined processor as tasks are performed.

###DataStructures
* Binary Tree (C++)

		A custom made binary tree data structure.
		
* Doubly Linked List (C++)

		A custom made doubly-linked-list data structure.
		
* Hash Tables (C++)

		A custom made hashing data structure.
		
* Stack (C++)

		A stack adapter for a linked-list.
		
* Usage Statistics (C++)

		A file parser which fills data structures and prints sorted based on Character, Word, and Order of usage.

###Java
* Generic Classes Use Case (Java)
		
		A small Java project which demonstrates using Generic Classes.
		
* Graphic User Interface with Directory Scraping and Shape Drawing (Java)

		Small GUI which can draw pictures, or scrape a desired directory.
		
* Stratego (Java)

		The board game, made in Java-this was a group project. 
		
		I was responsible for the entirety of the user interface, graphic design, and assisted in the logic.

###Operating Systems
* Unix Shell Emulator (C)

		Calls various Unix commands to create a small unix shell.

###Python
* Cubism (Python)

		An original procedurally generated dungeon crawler-this was a group project. 
		
		The focus of this game was to generate levels procedurally, and as such graphics were simplified. 
		
		This is made using the Pygame library. 
		
		My contributions include researching and choosing Pygame for the task, coming up with the rectangle extension method for creating nearly every object in the game, and creating a player, wall, and room class. I also am responsible for the progression design (powerups) and floor generation algorithm.
		
* Web Scraping (Python)

		Two projects which scrape imgur, and the department's faculty page to get information.
		
* Boggle (Python)

		Final project, implements Boggle in Python with a GUI.
		
* Sine Wave Plotting (Python)

		Uses Python to plot various Sine Wave functions, as a demonstration of math modeling.
		
* Text Based Dungeon Crawler (Python)

		A simple text based dungeon crawler assignment, find the objective, fight the bad guys, avoid instant death.
